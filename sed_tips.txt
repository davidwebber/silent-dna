Or use this solution with sed:

sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/ /g'
This will read the whole file in a loop, then replaces the newline(s) with a space.

Update: explanation.

create a label via :a
append the current and next line to the pattern space via N
if we are before the last line, branch to the created label $!ba ($! means not to do it on the last line (as there should be one final newline)).
finally the substitution replaces every newline with a space on the pattern space (which is the whole file).
