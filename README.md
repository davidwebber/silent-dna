Installation

Follow the instructions at 
http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_BioPerl
under the headings appropriate for your operating system.
(I used http://www.bioperl.org/wiki/Installing_BioPerl_on_Unix under sections
 - Preparing to Install
 - Installing using CPAN (first do the steps under "Installing in a personal module area")
)

You know what?  never mind.  just do 
$ sudo apt-get install bioperl
